# MechaCar-
## Module 16
This repository contains the code to help MechaCar production troubles
with the goal to be more efficient in their lines for the upcoming prototype.

## Results:

## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils
## T-Tests on Suspension Coils
Here are the results assuming a "true mean" of 1500 psi: Lot 1 had a p-value of 1, meaning it is highly likely that the mean is not different from 1500. Lot 2 had a p-value of 0.607, indicating that there is enough evidence to suggest that the mean is not different from 1500. However, Lot 3 had a p-value of 0.042, which suggests that it is likely that the mean is different from 1500 psi.

## Study Design: MechaCar vs Competition
To compare the MechaCar with other cars, we need to look at different factors like cost,  efficiency, horsepower ,price bewtween others. . We will take these factors and average them for each car this way we will be able to perform statistical tests to determine if there are significant differences between the MechaCar and other cars. If the p-value is greater than 0.05, so we can  say that there is a significant difference between the MechaCar and its competitors in that particular factor.
